**Articles** is simple responsive web App.
It's built based on vanilla MVC/Repositories/Services architecture.
You can surf top 20 breaking news articles on five navigation bar links by category,
save and delete your favorite links in local MySQL database.

### How to start up.

- Clone and open project in your preferred IDE.
  Enter **Your API Key** from [News API](https://newsapi.org) in project `.env` file:

```php

```

- Run this command in project root folder. It will start localhost server:

```php
